## 1. Elevator Pitch

**AI Web Test v1.0** is an intelligent, **multi-agent agentic AI test automation platform** built specifically for telecom IT teams to dramatically reduce test creation time from days to minutes. Using a coordinated system of specialized AI agents and the Stagehand testing framework powered by LLMs via OpenRouter API, the platform automates the complete testing lifecycle—from requirements analysis and test case generation to autonomous execution, self-healing, and intelligent reporting—for both public-facing telecom websites and internal intranet systems. 

The platform employs **six specialized AI agents** that collaborate autonomously:
- **Requirements Agent**: Analyzes requirements and generates comprehensive test scenarios
- **Generation Agent**: Creates executable test cases from natural language
- **Execution Agent**: Orchestrates test runs with intelligent parallelization
- **Observation Agent**: Monitors execution and detects anomalies in real-time
- **Analysis Agent**: Performs root cause analysis and provides insights
- **Evolution Agent**: Continuously learns and improves test coverage

This multi-agent architecture addresses critical pain points of manual testing overhead, high UAT defect rates, and developer time constraints by providing a polished web-based dashboard where QA teams, developers, and business users can leverage autonomous AI agents that create, execute, heal, and evolve tests without human intervention.
