- **PostgreSQL optimizations: Deferred to Sprint 10+** (when Developer B ready or when we need scale)
- Deployment: Docker Compose locally or direct Python processes
- Monitoring: Python logging + basic metrics endpoint

**Phase 4 (Production-Ready - Complex Infrastructure):**
- Kubernetes cluster for auto-scaling (when we have >100 users)
- Redis Streams upgrade (when we need >1000 messages/sec)
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack (when we need dashboards)
- Load balancers and HA setup (when we need 99.9% uptime)

**Rationale:** Phase 3 focuses on **agent functionality**, not infrastructure. Use simplest tools that work, defer complexity to Phase 4 when we have proven value and need scale.

### Sprint 7: AnalysisAgent Implementation (Independent - Jan 23 - Feb 5, 2026) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status:** All Sprint 7 tasks completed (Jan 23-29, 2026) - 46 story points delivered

**Developer A works independently while Developer B completes Phase 2:**

#### Developer A Tasks (46 points - INDEPENDENT, NO DEPENDENCIES ON DEVELOPER B)

**Option 1: AnalysisAgent Implementation (Recommended - Can Start Immediately)**

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies | Points |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **7A.4** | ✅ Implement AnalysisAgent class with FMEA risk scoring (RPN calculation) | 5 days | Pre-Sprint 7 (EA.1-EA.6) | 13 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.5** | ✅ LLM integration for structured risk analysis (severity/occurrence/detection) | 3 days | 7A.4 | 8 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.6** | ✅ Historical data integration (use existing database - SQLite/PostgreSQL) | 2 days | 7A.4 | 5 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.7** | ✅ ROI calculation and execution time estimation | 2 days | 7A.5 | 5 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.8** | ✅ Dependency analysis with topological sort (cycle detection) | 2 days | 7A.4 | 5 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.9** | ✅ Business value scoring (revenue, users, compliance) | 1 day | 7A.5 | 3 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.10** | ✅ Coverage impact analysis and regression risk assessment | 2 days | 7A.5 | 5 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.11** | ✅ Unit tests for AnalysisAgent (44 tests, LLM mocking) | 1 day | 7A.7, 7A.8 | 3 | **COMPLETE** |
| **7A.12** | ✅ Integration tests (3-agent workflow: Observe → Requirements → Analyze) | 2 days | 7A.11 | 5 | **COMPLETE** |

**Total: 46 points, 13 days - ZERO dependencies on Developer B or Phase 2**

**Option 2: Simple Redis Pub/Sub Setup (DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11)**

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies | Points | Status |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| **7A.13** | Install Redis locally (or use Docker) | 0.5 day | None | 1 | **DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11** |
| **7A.14** | Replace message bus stub with simple Redis pub/sub | 1 day | 7A.13 | 2 | **DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11** |
| **7A.15** | Replace agent registry stub with Redis-backed version | 1 day | 7A.14 | 2 | **DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11** |
| **7A.16** | Integration tests (agents + real Redis) | 0.5 day | 7A.15 | 1 | **DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11** |

**Total: 6 points, 3 days - DEFERRED TO SPRINT 11**

**Note:** Message bus implementation (Redis Streams) is planned for Sprint 11 (Mar 20 - Apr 2, 2026) along with Learning System and event-driven communication. Current implementation uses direct data flow (synchronous function calls) which is fully operational.

**Note:** Redis pub/sub is simple (just `publish`/`subscribe` commands). No need for Redis Streams or complex setup. Can use existing database (SQLite for local dev) - no PostgreSQL changes needed until later.

#### Developer B Tasks (When Phase 2 Complete - DEFERRED TO LATER SPRINT)

**PostgreSQL Setup Deferred:** No need to add agent tables now. Use existing database (SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL in production) as-is. PostgreSQL-specific optimizations can be added later when needed.

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies | Points | Sprint |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| **7B.1** | Add agent-related tables to existing database (PostgreSQL) | 2 days | Phase 2 DB | 5 | Sprint 10+ |
| **7B.2** | Implement three-layer memory system (working memory + database) | 3 days | 7B.1 | 5 | Sprint 10+ |

| **7B.4** | Implement FeedbackCollector class | 2 days | 7B.3 | 3 | Sprint 10+ |
| **7B.5** | Unit tests for infrastructure (30+ tests) | 1 day | 7B.1-7B.4 | 3 | Sprint 10+ |

**Total: 19 points, 6 days - DEFERRED TO SPRINT 10+ (When Developer B Ready)**

**Rationale:** 
- Use existing database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) as-is - no schema changes needed for AnalysisAgent
- Historical data queries work with existing `test_executions` table
- PostgreSQL optimizations can wait until we need scale or Developer B is available
- Focus on agent functionality first, infrastructure later

**Sprint 7 Success Criteria (Developer A Independent Path) - ✅ ALL COMPLETE:**
- ✅ AnalysisAgent class implemented with FMEA risk scoring (RPN calculation) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ LLM integration with Azure GPT-4o operational (structured risk analysis output) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ AnalysisAgent calculates ROI for each scenario (explicit formula with effort estimation) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ AnalysisAgent estimates execution times (heuristics-based, categorized as fast/medium/slow) - **COMPLETE**

- ✅ AnalysisAgent uses existing database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for historical data queries - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Real-time test execution integration (3-tier strategy: Playwright → observe+XPath → Stagehand AI) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Adaptive scoring based on execution success rates (Detection score adjustment) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ 3-agent workflow operational: Observe → Requirements → Analyze (using stubs) - **COMPLETE**

- ✅ Browser visibility control (HEADLESS_BROWSER env var) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ E2E testing with real page execution (Three HK 5G Broadband page) - **COMPLETE**

**Note:** 
- AnalysisAgent implementation details are already prepared and documented in [Implementation Guide Section 3.3](Phase3-Implementation-Guide-Complete.md#33-analysisagent-implementation-enhanced---fmea-based-risk-analysis)
- Developer A can start immediately using stub infrastructure (message bus stub, agent registry stub)
- **Use existing database as-is** (SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL in production) - no schema changes needed
- Historical data queries work with existing `test_executions` table
- **Redis pub/sub is optional** - can be added in Sprint 7 if Developer A has time (simple setup), or deferred to later
- **PostgreSQL optimizations deferred** to Sprint 10+ when Developer B is ready or when we need scale

## Post-Sprint 9: Gap Analysis & Strategic Planning (Feb 10, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Document:** [Sprint 10 Gap Analysis and Implementation Plan](SPRINT_10_GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_PLAN.md)

### Critical Gaps Identified

After successful Phase 2 + Phase 3 merge and integration testing, comprehensive gap analysis revealed:

#### Gap #1: Frontend-Agent Integration (CRITICAL - Sprint 10)
**Problem:**
- Backend agents work perfectly but workflow is invisible to users
- No UI to trigger agent workflow
- No real-time progress visibility
- Tests appear in frontend but generation process is hidden

**Solution (Sprint 10):**
- Real-time agent progress UI (GitHub Actions style pipeline)
- "AI Generate Tests" trigger button with configuration form
- Server-Sent Events for live progress streaming
- Workflow results review interface (approve/edit/reject)

**Industrial Best Practices Applied:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Step-by-step execution with logs
- **ChatGPT:** Streaming responses with intermediate steps
- **Airflow:** Agent dependency visualization
- **Vercel:** Real-time deployment progress

#### Gap #2: Autonomous Self-Improvement (CRITICAL - Sprint 11)
**Problem:**
- Basic feedback loop exists but manual
- No automated prompt optimization
- No pattern learning and reuse (missing 90% cost reduction)
- No self-healing for broken tests
- No continuous performance monitoring

**Solution (Sprint 11):**
- **Automated A/B Testing:** Generate variants, auto-promote winners
- **Pattern Library:** Extract and reuse successful patterns (90% cost savings)
- **Self-Healing Engine:** Auto-repair tests when UI changes
- **Performance Monitor:** Detect degradation, trigger auto-recovery

**Self-Improvement Mechanisms:**
```
1. Prompt Optimization → 15% quality improvement in 3 months
2. Pattern Reuse → 90% cost reduction (from $0.16 to $0.016 per test)
3. Self-Healing → 80%+ auto-repair rate for "element not found"
4. Auto-Recovery → <1 minute rollback on critical degradation
```

#### Gap #3: Real-Time Communication (HIGH - Sprint 10 & 11)
**Problem:**
- Agent communication is synchronous (direct method calls)
- Frontend polling every 5 seconds (inefficient)
- Message bus is stub (not operational)

**Solution:**
- **Sprint 10:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress
- **Sprint 11:** Redis Streams message bus (event-driven architecture)

### Impact on Sprint Planning

**Sprint 10 Revised:**
- **Before:** Basic API integration (24 points)
- **After:** Full frontend-agent integration with real-time UI (76 points)
- **New Focus:** User experience, industrial UI patterns, SSE implementation, comprehensive testing

**Sprint 11 Revised:**
- **Before:** Manual learning system setup (22 points)
- **After:** Fully autonomous learning with 4 mechanisms (56 points)
- **New Focus:** True autonomy, self-healing, auto-optimization

**Success Metrics Updated:**
| Metric | Original Target | Revised Target | Autonomous Mechanism |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| User Visibility | N/A | 100% real-time | SSE streaming |
| Self-Improvement | Manual | Fully automated | A/B testing + patterns |
| Cost per Test | $0.16 | $0.016 (90% reduction) | Pattern reuse |
| Test Pass Rate | 70% | 85%+ | Self-healing + optimization |
| Recovery Time | Manual | <1 minute | Auto-rollback |

**Developer B Phase 3 Completion Summary (Feb 26, 2026):**

✅ **10B.11 Agent Status Progress Tracking (Structured SSE) - COMPLETE**
- Created `AgentStatusMonitor.tsx` component with simplified, clean architecture
- Displays structured progress timeline with per-agent metrics (elements found, scenarios generated, tests generated, execution time)
- Optional expandable "View Logs" section for backend DEBUG/INFO logs (toggleable, not default)
- Real-time updates via SSE events (agent_started, agent_progress, agent_completed, workflow_completed)
- Integrated into `AgentProgressPipeline` as sibling panel, not duplicative
- Tests: 100% passing (new test file: AgentStatusMonitor.test.tsx)
- Key benefit: Clean, scannable 1-page progress vs. verbose 100+ line raw logs; follows GitHub Actions/Vercel UI patterns

✅ **10B.12 Stop Agent Button - COMPLETE**
- Created `StopAgentButton.tsx` standalone component with state awareness and error handling
- Shows "⏹ Stop Agent" button in pipeline header; disabled when workflow completed/failed/cancelled
- Confirmation dialog before stop to prevent accidental cancellation
- Calls DELETE /workflows/{id} and waits for backend-confirmed status change
- No optimistic state forcing; SSE stream stays alive during cancellation for clean shutdown
- Integrated into `AgentProgressPipeline` and wired in `AgentWorkflowPage`
- Tests: 100% passing (StopAgentButton.test.tsx + page-level regression test)
- User-facing flow: click stop → confirm → "Stopping..." → wait for SSE "cancelled" event → UI updates

**Backend A Enhancements (Beyond Original Plan - Mid-Stage Cancellation):**
- ✅ Extended `orchestration_service.py`: wired `progress_callback` and `cancel_check` to ALL 4 agent payloads
  - Observation: 2 callback emissions (0.25 progress on initial crawl, 0.75 progress on extraction)
  - Requirements: 8-stage execution with callback after each stage + cooperative cancel checks between stages
  - Analysis: 10-stage execution with real-time batch loop polling cancel check every batch
  - Evolution: per-scenario progress (already wired in earlier sprints)
- ✅ Updated `requirements_agent.py`: Added cooperative `cancel_check()` polling between 8 internal stages
  - Stages: grouping → journeys → functional → accessibility → security → edge-case → test-data → coverage
  - Each stage emits progress callback (0.05 to 1.0 range normalized) and checks cancel flag
  - On cancel: returns early with empty scenarios and `metadata={"cancelled": True}`
- ✅ Updated `analysis_agent.py`: Added cooperative cancel polling during stage execution and real-time batch loop
  - Stages: historical data → risk scoring → business values → ROI → execution time → dependencies → coverage → regression → real-time execution → success analysis → prioritization
  - Real-time batch loop: checks cancel flag before each batch, emits per-batch progress (0.68 to 0.78 range)
  - On cancel: returns early with empty risk_scores and `metadata={"cancelled": True}`
- Result: Stop now works **mid-stage** (not just between agents), enabling fast response to user cancellation requests
- Tests: 5 backend unit tests passing (test_orchestration_stage_progress.py: 2 tests; test_evolution_agent_progress_cancel.py: 1 test; test_orchestration_cancel.py: 2 tests)
- No regression: AnalysisAgent baseline tests passing (execute_task_basic, can_handle)

### Agent Status Display & Stop Button: Design & Implementation (10B.11 & 10B.12 Details)

#### Overview

Developer B testing the agent workflow requires **visibility into agent execution** and the **ability to stop long-running workflows**. Rather than displaying raw backend logs (verbose and noisy), the frontend uses **structured SSE events** from the backend to show meaningful progress with optional detailed logs.

#### 10B.11: Agent Status Progress Tracking (Structured SSE)

**Problem:** Raw logs are 100+ lines, hard to parse, contain token counts and internal details. Developers get lost.

**Solution:** Display **structured progress timeline** from SSE events, with optional **expandable logs** section for drilling down.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// frontend/src/features/agent-workflow/components/AgentStatusMonitor.tsx
export const AgentStatusMonitor: React.FC<{ workflowId: string }> = ({ workflowId }) => {
  const { progress, logs, isLoading } = useWorkflowProgress(workflowId);
  const [showLogs, setShowLogs] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="agent-status-monitor">
      {/* Structured Progress Timeline */}
      <div className="progress-timeline">
        {progress.agents.map((agent) => (
          <div key={agent.name} className="agent-step">
            <div className="step-header">
              <span className="agent-name">{agent.name}</span>
              <span className="duration">{agent.duration_seconds?.toFixed(1)}s</span>
              <span className="status-badge">{agent.status}</span>
            </div>
            
            {agent.status === 'running' && (
              <progress value={agent.progress} max={1} className="progress-bar" />
            )}
            
            {agent.message && (
              <p className="status-message">{agent.message}</p>
            )}
            
            {agent.elements_found && (
              <p className="detail">✓ Found {agent.elements_found} UI elements (confidence: {agent.confidence?.toFixed(2)})</p>
            )}
            {agent.scenarios_generated && (
              <p className="detail">✓ Generated {agent.scenarios_generated} scenarios</p>
            )}
            {agent.scenarios_executed && (
              <p className="detail">✓ Executed {agent.scenarios_executed} scenarios in real-time</p>
            )}
            {agent.tests_generated && (
              <p className="detail">✓ Generated {agent.tests_generated} test cases</p>
            )}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Optional: Expandable Logs Section */}
      <div className="logs-section">
        <button onClick={() => setShowLogs(!showLogs)} className="toggle-logs">
          {showLogs ? '▼' : '▶'} Backend Logs ({logs.length} events)
        </button>
        
        {showLogs && (
          <div className="log-viewer">
            {logs.map((log, idx) => (
              <div key={idx} className={`log-line log-${log.level}`}>
                <span className="timestamp">{log.timestamp}</span>
                <span className="level">[{log.level}]</span>
                <span className="message">{log.message}</span>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>

      {/* Stop Button */}
      <button 
        onClick={handleStopAgent}
        disabled={progress.status === 'completed' || progress.status === 'failed'}
        className="btn-stop-agent"
      >
        ⏹ Stop Agent
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**SSE Events (Backend → Frontend):**

The backend `OrchestrationService` emits structured events via `GET /api/v2/workflows/{id}/stream`:

```json
event: agent_started
data: {"agent": "observation", "timestamp": "2026-02-26T10:00:00Z"}

event: agent_progress
data: {"agent": "observation", "progress": 0.65, "message": "Found 38 elements, analyzing..."}

event: agent_completed
data: {
  "agent": "observation",
  "elements_found": 38,
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "duration_seconds": 12.5
}

event: agent_started
data: {"agent": "requirements", "timestamp": "2026-02-26T10:00:13Z"}

event: agent_progress
data: {"agent": "requirements", "progress": 0.40, "message": "Generating 8 BDD scenarios..."}

event: agent_completed
data: {
  "agent": "requirements",
  "scenarios_generated": 18,
  "duration_seconds": 18.3
}

event: agent_started
data: {"agent": "analysis", "timestamp": "2026-02-26T10:00:31Z"}

event: agent_progress
data: {"agent": "analysis", "progress": 0.75, "message": "Executing 5 critical scenarios in real-time..."}

event: agent_completed
data: {
  "agent": "analysis",
  "scenarios_executed": 17,
  "duration_seconds": 45.0
}

event: agent_started
data: {"agent": "evolution", "timestamp": "2026-02-26T10:01:16Z"}

event: agent_progress
data: {"agent": "evolution", "progress": 0.50, "message": "Generating test code for 17 scenarios..."}

event: agent_completed
data: {
  "agent": "evolution",
  "tests_generated": 17,
  "duration_seconds": 22.1
}

event: workflow_completed
data: {
  "workflow_id": "wf-123",
  "status": "completed",
  "total_duration_seconds": 97.9,
  "test_case_ids": [101, 102, 103, ..., 117]
}
```

**React Hook (Frontend):**

```typescript
// frontend/src/features/agent-workflow/hooks/useWorkflowProgress.ts
export const useWorkflowProgress = (workflowId: string) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState<WorkflowProgress>({
    status: 'pending',
    agents: [],
    total_progress: 0
  });
  const [logs, setLogs] = useState<LogEvent[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/v2/workflows/${workflowId}/stream`);

    eventSource.addEventListener('agent_started', (e) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
      setProgress(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        agents: [...prev.agents, { name: data.agent, status: 'running', progress: 0 }]
      }));
    });

    eventSource.addEventListener('agent_progress', (e) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
      setProgress(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        agents: prev.agents.map(a => 
          a.name === data.agent 
            ? { ...a, progress: data.progress, message: data.message }
            : a
        )
      }));
    });

    eventSource.addEventListener('agent_completed', (e) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
      setProgress(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        agents: prev.agents.map(a =>
          a.name === data.agent
            ? { 
                ...a, 
                status: 'completed', 
                progress: 1,
                duration_seconds: data.duration_seconds,
                elements_found: data.elements_found,
                scenarios_generated: data.scenarios_generated,
                scenarios_executed: data.scenarios_executed,
                tests_generated: data.tests_generated,
                confidence: data.confidence
              }
            : a
        )
      }));
    });

    eventSource.addEventListener('workflow_completed', (e) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
      setProgress(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        status: 'completed',
        total_duration_seconds: data.total_duration_seconds
      }));
      eventSource.close();
    });

    return () => eventSource.close();
  }, [workflowId]);

  return { progress, logs, isLoading: progress.status === 'pending' };
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean, scannable progress display (4 agents, not 100+ log lines)
- ✅ Real-time updates via SSE (no polling overhead)
- ✅ Backend logs available via optional toggle (for debugging)
- ✅ Shows meaningful metrics: elements found, confidence, execution time, test count
- ✅ Easy to correlate with backend logs by timestamp
- ✅ Matches industrial UI patterns (GitHub Actions, ChatGPT, Vercel)

#### 10B.12: Stop Agent Button Implementation — ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 26, 2026)

**Problem:** Long-running workflows (5+ minutes) need a way to stop early for testing, with user confirmation and clear response feedback.

**Solution:** Add **"⏹ Stop Agent" button** with confirmation dialog, state-aware UI, and backend-confirmed cancellation semantics.

**Actual Implementation (Completed):**

Created `frontend/src/features/agent-workflow/components/StopAgentButton.tsx`:
```typescript
export const StopAgentButton: React.FC<{
  workflowId: string;
  workflowStatus: WorkflowStatus;
  onStop?: () => void;
}> = ({ workflowId, workflowStatus, onStop }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    if (!confirm('Stop running agent? This action cannot be undone.')) return;

    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    try {
      const response = await agentWorkflowService.cancelWorkflow(workflowId);
      if (response.ok) {
        setError(null);
        if (onStop) onStop();
      } else {
        setError('Failed to stop agent; workflow may already be complete');
      }
    } catch (err) {
      setError(`Error stopping agent: ${(err as Error).message}`);
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  const isDisabled = 
    workflowStatus === 'completed' || 
    workflowStatus === 'failed' || 
    workflowStatus === 'cancelled' || 
    isLoading;

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick} disabled={isDisabled} className="btn-stop-agent">
        {isLoading ? '⏳ Stopping...' : '⏹ Stop Agent'}
      </button>
      {error && <div className="alert alert-error mt-2">{error}</div>}
    </>
  );
};
```

**Integration Points:**
- `AgentProgressPipeline.tsx` - renders `StopAgentButton` in header when `onStop` prop provided
- `AgentWorkflowPage.tsx` - mounts `StopAgentButton` and passes `useWorkflowProgress().cancel` callback
- `useWorkflowProgress.ts` hook - handles SSE cancellation event and backend-confirmed state transition

**Backend Cancel Flow (Already Implemented in 10A.5b):**
1. Frontend calls `DELETE /api/v2/workflows/{id}`
2. Backend sets `cancel_requested` flag in workflow store
3. All 4 agents poll `cancel_check()` during execution (observation, requirements, analysis, evolution)
4. First agent to check cancellation flag returns early with partial results + `metadata={"cancelled": true}`
5. Orchestration service emits `workflow_failed` SSE event with cancellation marker
6. Frontend `useWorkflowProgress` receives event and updates workflow status to "cancelled"
7. User sees "Workflow cancelled" and SSE connection closes gracefully

**Key Implementation Details:**
- ✅ **Cooperative cancellation**: agents are not forcefully killed; they poll and return early
- ✅ **Mid-stage cancellation**: cancel works during agent execution, not just between stages (thanks to callback pattern)
- ✅ **No optimistic state**: frontend waits for backend-confirmed "cancelled" status (not forced local state)
- ✅ **SSE-safe**: SSE stream stays open during cancellation request for clean shutdown
- ✅ **State aware**: button disabled when workflow already terminal (completed/failed/cancelled)
- ✅ **Error handling**: shows error toast if cancellation request fails

**Test Coverage:**
- `StopAgentButton.test.tsx` - 4 test cases (button state, click handler, error display, confirm dialog)
- `AgentWorkflowPage.test.tsx` - page-level integration test for stop button + SSE wiring
- Backend unit tests - 5 tests covering orchestration + cancel + progress (all passing)

**Actual User Flow:**
1. User clicks "⏹ Stop Agent" button
2. Confirmation dialog: "Stop running agent? This action cannot be undone."
3. User confirms
4. Button shows "⏳ Stopping..." and becomes disabled
5. Frontend calls DELETE /api/v2/workflows/{id}
6. Backend sets cancel flag; agents check and return early
7. Backend emits "workflow_failed" SSE event with cancellation marker
8. Frontend receives SSE event: `{ "status": "cancelled", "error": "Cancelled by user" }`
9. `useWorkflowProgress` hook updates progress state to cancelled
10. Button shows "⏹ Stop Agent" (disabled) with "Workflow cancelled" message below
11. User can navigate away or generate new workflow
// Provide user feedback
toast.loading('Stopping agent...');

const response = await fetch(`/api/v2/workflows/${workflowId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE'
});

if (response.ok) {
  toast.success('Agent workflow stopped', {
    description: 'Redirecting to test list...',
    duration: 2000
  });
  
  // Redirect after toast
  setTimeout(() => navigate('/tests'), 2000);
} else {
  toast.error('Failed to stop agent workflow');
}
```

**Button Styling & States:**

| State | UI | Disabled | Action |
|-------|----|---------| -------|
| Running | Red button, ⏹ Stop Agent | No | Show confirmation → DELETE request |
| Completed | Gray button | Yes | Already done |
| Failed | Gray button | Yes | Already failed |
| Cancelled | Gray button | Yes | Already cancelled |

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Developers can stop long-running workflows without killing the process
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (agent can clean up, save partial results if needed)
- ✅ Clear confirmation prevents accidental stops
- ✅ User feedback via toast notifications
- ✅ Disabled state prevents stopping after workflow done
- ✅ Reuses existing DELETE endpoint (already in API spec)

### Developer B Sprint 10.5: OpenRouter Free Models + Batch Delete Tests (Mar 9 - Mar 19, 2026)

**Owner:** Developer B  
**Status:** 📋 **PLANNED** — Fills Developer B gap between Sprint 10 completion (Feb 26) and Sprint 11 start (Mar 20)  
**Branch:** `feature/sprint10-5-openrouter-models-batch-delete`  
**Story Points:** 13 points / ~6 days

**Background:**  
Developer B's Sprint 10 tasks (10B.11 + 10B.12) are fully complete as of Feb 26. Before Sprint 11 begins March 20, these two product improvements are high-value, low-risk enhancements that improve usability for both settings management (free-tier users can now access 15+ $0 models) and test management (users with large test libraries can delete multiple tests in one action).

---

#### Feature 1: OpenRouter Free Models in Settings (7 points)

**Goal:** Expand the OpenRouter model list in Settings → Test Case Generation and Settings → Test Execution to include all current models with $0/M input and $0/M output tokens from [openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high), and visually distinguish free models from paid ones in the dropdown.

**Why:** Free-tier users need workable models without configuring paid API keys. Current free model list is stale (8 models, some inactive). Expanding to 19 verified $0/$0 models is a quick win that improves the new-user experience and enables zero-cost test generation out of the box.

##### Phase 1: Backend — Expand Free Model List

**Step 1: Update `PROVIDER_CONFIGS` in `user_settings_service.py`** *(File: `backend/app/services/user_settings_service.py`)*

- **Action:** Replace the stale OpenRouter model list in `PROVIDER_CONFIGS["openrouter"]["models"]` with the verified list below (confirmed `$0/M input` and `$0/M output` on OpenRouter as of Mar 9 2026). Image-generation models (FLUX, Seedream, Riverflow) are excluded — only text/instruct/chat models are included. Move all paid models (no `:free` suffix, e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-*`) to the bottom of the list or remove them.
- **Full verified free model list (`$0/$0`):**

  | Model ID | Context | Notes |
  |----------|---------|-------|
  | `qwen/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b:free` | 262K | ⭐ **Recommended** — coder model, best for test generation |
  | `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` | 128K | High weekly usage (1.69B tokens), very capable instruct |
  | `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` | 131K | Large OpenAI OSS model, strong reasoning |
  | `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` | 131K | Lighter OpenAI OSS model, fast |
  | `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct:free` | 262K | Large context, strong for long-form generation |
  | `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` | 256K | 256K context, MoE architecture, fast |
  | `google/gemma-3-27b:free` | 131K | Stable, widely available, 550M weekly tokens |
  | `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free` | 128K | Stable Mistral, 128K context |
  | `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` | 131K | 57B weekly tokens — highly active |
  | `arcee-ai/trinity-mini:free` | 131K | Compact frontier model from Arcee AI |
  | `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` | 256K | 30B params, 3B active (MoE) |
  | `nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free` | 128K | Lightweight Nemotron, 128K context |
  | `google/gemma-3-12b:free` | 32K | Smaller Gemma, fast inference |
  | `google/gemma-3-4b:free` | 32K | Smallest Gemma, low latency |
  | `qwen/qwen3-4b:free` | 40K | Compact Qwen3 for execution agent |
  | `meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free` | 131K | Lightweight Llama for fast execution |
  | `nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b:free` | 131K | Largest free model, best quality ceiling |
  | `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` | — | Existing recommended model (retain) |
  | `google/gemini-flash-1.5:free` | — | Existing stable fallback (retain) |

- **Remove from list** (no longer free or stale): `qwen/qwen-2-7b-instruct:free`, all paid models (`gpt-4o`, `claude-3-*`)
- **Update recommended model** to `qwen/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b:free` — purpose-built coder model, ideal for generating Playwright/Stagehand test code
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Risk:** Low — only adds entries to a static config dict

**Step 2: Add `is_free` flag to `AvailableProvider` schema** *(File: `backend/app/schemas/user_settings.py`)*

- **Action:** Add optional `is_free: bool` field to each model entry so the frontend can render a "(Free)" badge. Extend the model list from `List[str]` to `List[ModelOption]` where `ModelOption` has `id: str`, `display_name: str`, `is_free: bool`.
- **Why:** Enables frontend to visually group and label free vs paid models without string parsing hacks.
- **Risk:** Medium — schema change must be backwards-compatible; frontend must handle both old and new shape (use union type or keep `List[str]` as a computed property alongside `model_options`)
- **Mitigation:** Add `model_options` as a **new** field alongside existing `models: List[str]`. Frontend reads `model_options` if present, falls back to `models`. Old callers unaffected.

**Step 3: Unit tests** *(File: `backend/tests/unit/test_user_settings_service.py`)*

- **Action:** Add test asserting all `:free` models have `is_free=True` in `model_options`; assert `get_available_providers()` returns at least 19 free OpenRouter models; assert `qwen/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b:free` is present as recommended
- **Risk:** Low

##### Phase 2: Frontend — Free Model UI

**Step 4: Update model dropdown in `SettingsPage.tsx`** *(File: `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`)*

- **Action:** Replace flat `<option>` list with grouped `<optgroup>` elements: **"Free Models ($0)"** group first, **"Paid Models"** group second. Each free model option shows `model-id (Free)` label. For paid models, show `model-id` only.
- **Implementation pattern:**
  ```tsx
  <select>
    <optgroup label="🆓 Free Models ($0/M tokens)">
      {freeModels.map(m => <option key={m}>{m} (Free)</option>)}
    </optgroup>
    <optgroup label="💰 Paid Models">
      {paidModels.map(m => <option key={m}>{m}</option>)}
    </optgroup>
  </select>
  ```
- **Logic:** Detect free models using `model_options[].is_free` from API, or fall back to `.endsWith(':free')` string check if new schema not yet deployed.
- **Apply to:** Both Generation Provider model dropdown (line ~408) and Execution Provider model dropdown (line ~508).
- **Dependencies:** Step 2 (schema), Step 1 (more models in list)
- **Risk:** Low

**Step 5: Frontend unit tests** *(File: `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.test.tsx` or existing test file)*

- **Action:** Add test asserting free models are rendered under `"Free Models"` optgroup, paid models under `"Paid Models"` optgroup; assert `(Free)` label on free models
- **Risk:** Low

##### Implementation Order & File Map

| Step | File | Owner | Effort |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `backend/app/services/user_settings_service.py` | Dev B | 1 day |
| 2 | `backend/app/schemas/user_settings.py` | Dev B | 0.5 day |
| 3 | `backend/tests/unit/test_user_settings_service.py` | Dev B | 0.5 day |
| 4 | `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` | Dev B | 0.5 day |
| 5 | `frontend/src/pages/SettingsPage.test.tsx` | Dev B | 0.5 day |

**Total Feature 1: 7 points / ~3 days**

---

#### Feature 2: Batch Delete Saved Tests UI (6 points)

**Goal:** Allow users to select multiple saved tests on `SavedTestsPage` and delete them all in one action, instead of individually clicking delete per test.

**Why:** Power users accumulate dozens of generated tests quickly. Individual deletion is tedious. A select-all + batch delete reduces a 5-minute cleanup to 10 seconds.

**Current state:** `SavedTestsPage.tsx` has a single-item `deleteTest(id)` call with a `confirm()` dialog. No multi-select exists. The backend `testsService.deleteTest(id)` deletes one test by ID.

##### Phase 1: Backend — Batch Delete Endpoint

**Step 6: Add `DELETE /api/v1/test-cases/batch` endpoint** *(File: `backend/app/api/...` — whichever router handles test-case CRUD)*

- **Action:** Accept `{ "ids": [1, 2, 3, ...] }` in request body. Delete all matching test cases that belong to the authenticated user. Return `{ "deleted": N, "failed": [] }`.
- **Guardrails:** Validate ownership — only delete tests belonging to the requesting user. Cap batch size at 100 IDs per request to prevent abuse. Return 400 if `ids` is empty.
- **Risk:** Medium — bulk delete is irreversible. Ownership check is critical to prevent cross-user deletion.
- **Mitigation:** Filter by `WHERE id IN (:ids) AND user_id = :current_user_id` at DB level; log deletion audit trail.

**Step 7: Add `batchDeleteTests(ids: number[])` to `testsService`** *(File: `frontend/src/services/testsService.ts` or equivalent)*

- **Action:** Call `DELETE /api/v1/test-cases/batch` with the array of IDs. Handle partial-success response.
- **Dependencies:** Step 6
- **Risk:** Low

**Step 8: Unit/integration tests for batch delete** *(File: `backend/tests/...`)*

- **Action:** Test: deletes multiple IDs; rejects empty array; ownership guard prevents cross-user delete; respects 100-ID cap
- **Risk:** Low

##### Phase 2: Frontend — Multi-Select UI

**Step 9: Add checkbox column and selection state to `SavedTestsPage.tsx`** *(File: `frontend/src/pages/SavedTestsPage.tsx`)*

- **Action:**
  1. Add `selectedIds: Set<number>` state
  2. Add a checkbox column as the first column in the tests table header and each row
  3. "Select All" / "Deselect All" toggle in the header checkbox
  4. Individual row checkbox toggles membership in `selectedIds`
  5. Add **"Delete Selected (N)"** button in the toolbar, only enabled when `selectedIds.size > 0`
  6. Confirmation modal: `Are you sure you want to delete N tests? This cannot be undone.` with Cancel / Delete buttons (replace `confirm()` with a proper modal for consistency)
  7. On confirm: call `batchDeleteTests([...selectedIds])`, show success toast `"N tests deleted"`, refresh list, clear selection

- **UI placement:** Toolbar row above the test table, left-aligned next to existing filter/sort controls.
- **Interaction rules:**
  - Checking "Select All" selects all tests matching the current filter (not just visible page)
  - Selecting 0 items: "Delete Selected" button is disabled and greyed out
  - During delete: button shows spinner, checkboxes disabled
  - After delete: refresh list, clear `selectedIds`

- **Dependencies:** Step 7 (service method)
- **Risk:** Low — additive UI change, does not modify existing single-delete flow

**Step 10: Frontend tests for batch delete** *(File: `frontend/src/pages/SavedTestsPage.test.tsx` or new test file)*

- **Action:** Test: checkbox selects individual item; Select All selects all; Delete Selected button disabled with 0 selection; calls `batchDeleteTests` with correct IDs on confirm; clears selection after success; shows error toast on partial failure
- **Risk:** Low

##### Implementation Order & File Map

| Step | File | Owner | Effort |

#### Sprint 10.5 Combined Task Table

| Task | Description | Duration | Dependencies | Risk |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|------|
| **10.5-B1** | Add 11 new free OpenRouter models to `PROVIDER_CONFIGS` | 1 day | None | Low |
| **10.5-B2** | Add `ModelOption` schema with `is_free` field | 0.5 day | 10.5-B1 | Low |
| **10.5-B3** | Backend unit tests (free models count assertion) | 0.5 day | 10.5-B2 | Low |
| **10.5-B4** | Frontend: grouped `<optgroup>` model dropdowns with Free badge | 0.5 day | 10.5-B2 | Low |
| **10.5-B5** | Frontend unit tests for model dropdown grouping | 0.5 day | 10.5-B4 | Low |
| **10.5-B6** | Backend: `DELETE /api/v1/test-cases/batch` endpoint | 1 day | None | Medium |
| **10.5-B7** | Frontend: `batchDeleteTests()` service method | 0.25 day | 10.5-B6 | Low |
| **10.5-B8** | Backend integration tests for batch delete | 0.5 day | 10.5-B6 | Low |
| **10.5-B9** | Frontend: checkbox multi-select + Delete Selected button in `SavedTestsPage` | 1 day | 10.5-B7 | Low |
| **10.5-B10** | Frontend tests for batch delete UI | 0.25 day | 10.5-B9 | Low |

**Total: 13 points / ~6 days**

#### Sprint 10.5 Success Criteria

- [ ] OpenRouter provider shows 19 free models in Settings dropdown for both Generation and Execution
- [ ] Free models are visually grouped and labeled `(Free)` in the dropdown
- [ ] Default recommended model is a working free model (no API key charges)
- [ ] `DELETE /api/v1/test-cases/batch` accepts up to 100 IDs, validates ownership, returns count deleted
- [ ] `SavedTestsPage` shows per-row checkboxes + Select All toggle + Delete Selected button
- [ ] Batch delete shows confirmation modal before executing
- [ ] Success toast confirms `"N tests deleted"` and refreshes the list
- [ ] All new tests pass in CI (backend pytest + frontend Vitest)
- [ ] No regression in existing single-delete or settings save flows

#### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Free OpenRouter models become unavailable/rate-limited | Medium | Low | Keep 3+ alternatives in list; existing fallback logic in `_build_openrouter_model_candidates()` already handles model unavailability |
| Batch delete accidentally deletes wrong user's tests | Low | High | DB-level `WHERE user_id = current_user` filter on every delete |
| Schema change (`ModelOption`) breaks existing frontend | Low | Medium | Additive-only change: keep `models: List[str]` alongside new `model_options` field |

### Sprint 11: Autonomous Learning System Activation (Mar 20 - Apr 2, 2026)

**Focus:** Achieve true autonomous self-improvement through automated learning mechanisms  
**Reference:** [Sprint 10 Gap Analysis - Autonomous Self-Improvement](SPRINT_10_GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_PLAN.md#-gap-3-autonomous-self-improvement-critical)

**Important:** The **Learning System** (this sprint) is the **core of continuous improvement**, not any individual agent. It operates at a meta-level above all agents, coordinating:
- Automated prompt optimization for all agents (A/B testing with auto-promotion)
- Pattern learning and reuse across agents (90% cost reduction)
- Self-healing test repair (auto-fix when UI changes)
- Continuous performance monitoring with auto-recovery

**Agent Roles:**
- **EvolutionAgent:** Generates test code, participates in learning loop via Learning System
- **All Agents:** Contribute execution results, metrics, patterns to Learning System
- **Learning System:** Coordinates optimization, A/B testing, pattern extraction across all agents

**Four Autonomous Mechanisms Implemented:**

#### Mechanism 1: Automated Prompt Optimization
```
Process:
1. Analyze high-quality examples (user rating >= 4 stars)
2. Generate 3 prompt variants using LLM
3. Run A/B test with 10% traffic (Thompson Sampling algorithm)
4. Measure quality metrics (pass rate, user rating, execution time)
5. Auto-promote winner if >5% improvement
6. Repeat weekly

Result: Continuous improvement without human intervention
```

#### Mechanism 2: Pattern Learning & Reuse
```
Process:
1. Extract patterns from successful tests (pass rate > 80%)
2. Store in vector database (Qdrant) with embeddings
3. On new generation, search for similar patterns
4. If match >85% confidence, reuse (no LLM call)

Result: 90% cost reduction, instant generation, higher quality
```

#### Mechanism 3: Self-Healing Tests
```
Process:
1. Test fails ("element not found")
2. Re-observe page with ObservationAgent
3. Find similar element (vector similarity > 0.75)
4. Update test with new selector
5. Re-run test, if passes → update permanently

Result: Tests adapt to UI changes automatically
```

#### Mechanism 4: Continuous Monitoring & Auto-Recovery
```
Metrics Tracked per Agent:
- ObservationAgent: Element accuracy (target: >90%)
- RequirementsAgent: Scenario quality (target: >0.85)
- AnalysisAgent: Risk prediction F1 (target: >0.80)
- EvolutionAgent: Test pass rate (target: >80%)

Auto-Recovery:
- Warning: >10% degradation → Increase experiment traffic
- Critical: >20% degradation → Rollback to previous prompt
```

| **Monitoring** | $0 | Python logging (console output) |
| **Subtotal Infrastructure** | **$0** ✅ |

**Phase 4 (Production - When We Need Scale):**

| Component | Cost | When to Upgrade |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Kubernetes (EKS)** | $431 | >100 concurrent users |
| **Redis Streams (3 nodes)** | $240 | >1000 messages/sec |
| **PostgreSQL HA** | $150 | Need 99.9% uptime |
| **Load Balancer** | $25 | Multiple backend instances |
| **Prometheus/Grafana** | $5 | Need metrics dashboard |
| **Subtotal Phase 4** | **$851** | Deferred |

**Key Insight:** Phase 3 costs **$0 infrastructure** by reusing existing Phase 2 setup!

### 4.2 LLM API Costs (Monthly)

**Assumptions:**
- 10 developers using system
- 5 test cycles/day per developer
- 20 working days/month
- **Total: 1,000 test cycles/month**

**Per Test Cycle Token Usage:**
- Observation Agent: 2,500 tokens
- Requirements Agent: 1,800 tokens
- Analysis Agent: 4,000 tokens
- **Evolution Agent: 8,000 tokens** (most expensive)
- Orchestration Agent: 700 tokens
- Reporting Agent: 3,000 tokens
- **Total: ~20,000 tokens per cycle**

**Strategy Options:**

| Strategy | Cost/Cycle | Monthly Cost (1K cycles) | Quality | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------|---------|----------------|
| All GPT-4 | $0.33 | $330 | 100% | Not cost-effective |
| **Hybrid Azure OpenAI** (GPT-4o for Observation/Evolution, GPT-4-mini for others) | **$0.16** | **$160** | 95% | **✅ Recommended** |
| All GPT-4-mini | $0.006 | $6 | 80% | Too low quality |
| **With 90% caching** (after Sprint 10) | **$0.016** | **$16** | 95% | **Future optimization** |

**Hybrid Azure OpenAI Strategy Details:**
- **Primary Provider:** Azure OpenAI (enterprise SLA, no Cloudflare blocks)
  - ObservationAgent: GPT-4o ($0.015 per page)
  - EvolutionAgent: GPT-4o (complex reasoning): $0.16/cycle
  - Other agents: GPT-4-mini (simple parsing): $0.004/cycle
- **Backup Provider:** Cerebras llama3.1-8b (free, 10x faster, fallback)
- **Caching Strategy:** Multi-tier (Hot: Redis 1h, Warm: PostgreSQL 7d, Cold: 30d)
- **Without caching:** $160/month
- **With 90% caching (Sprint 10+):** $16/month (90% cost reduction)
- **Current status:** Azure OpenAI tested successfully with Three HK website (262 elements detected)

### 4.3 Learning System Costs

**Phase 3 (Start Simple):**
- PostgreSQL storage: $0 (reuse existing database, add 8 tables)
- Perplexity AI API: $0 (defer to Phase 4, use manual prompt optimization)
- A/B testing: $0 (manual testing initially)
- Pattern mining: $0 (Python scripts on existing infrastructure)
- **Total Learning System: $0/month**

**Phase 4 (Automated Learning):**
- PostgreSQL storage expansion: $10/month
- Perplexity AI API (automated prompt optimization): $20/month
- A/B testing infrastructure: $10/month
- Pattern mining compute: $10/month
- **Total Learning System: $50/month** (when we need automation)

### 4.4 Total Monthly Budget

**Phase 3 (MVP):**

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Infrastructure** | $0 (reuse Phase 2) |
| **LLM API (Hybrid)** | $160 |
| **Learning System** | $0 (manual initially) |
| **TOTAL** | **$160/month** ✅ |

**Cost per Test Cycle:** $160 / 1,000 = **$0.16/cycle** (84% cheaper than original!)

**Phase 4 (Production Scale):**

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Infrastructure** | $851 |
| **LLM API (Hybrid)** | $160 |
| **Learning System** | $50 |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,061/month** |

### 4.5 Cost Optimization Strategies

**1. Caching (30% LLM savings)**
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
async def generate_test_cached(code_hash: str, requirements: str):
    if code_hash in cache:
        return cache[code_hash]  # Cache hit
    result = await generate_test(code_hash, requirements)
    cache[code_hash] = result
    return result
```
**Savings:** $160 × 0.30 = **$48/month**

**2. Compression (40% Redis memory savings)**
```python
import zlib
def compress_message(message: dict) -> bytes:
    return zlib.compress(json.dumps(message).encode())
```
**Savings:** $240 × 0.40 = **$96/month**

**3. Token Limit Enforcement (prevent runaway costs)**
```python
MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST = 10000
if len(input_tokens) > MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST:
    raise ValueError(f"Input exceeds {MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST} tokens")
```
**Savings:** Prevents unexpected $1000+ bills

**Optimized Monthly Cost:** $160 - $48 = **$112/month** (with caching)

**Phase 3 is 89% cheaper than original plan ($112 vs $1,061) while delivering same functionality!**

### 4.6 Scaling Projections

**When do we need Phase 4 infrastructure upgrade?**

| Metric | Phase 3 Limit | Upgrade Trigger | Phase 4 Capacity |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Concurrent Users** | 10-20 | >50 users | 1000+ users |
| **Messages/sec** | 100 | >500 msg/sec | 10,000 msg/sec |
| **Test Cycles/month** | 1,000-5,000 | >10,000 cycles | 100,000 cycles |
| **Uptime Required** | 95% (dev/test) | Need 99.9% | 99.99% |

**Phase 3 handles 10 developers comfortably. Upgrade to Phase 4 when product-market fit proven.**

### 4.7 ROI Justification

**Current Manual Testing:**
- QA engineer salary: $80,000/year = $6,667/month
- Time spent writing tests: 50% = $3,333/month

**Automated Testing (Phase 3 - Simplified):**
- Infrastructure + LLM: $112/month (with caching)
- Developer time saved: 10 developers × 1 hour/day × $50/hour × 20 days = $10,000/month

**Net Savings:** $10,000 - $112 = **$9,888/month** (~**89x ROI!**)

**Break-Even:** 0.1 developers using system (nearly instant ROI)

## 5. Security Design

### 5.1 Security Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Layer 5: Audit & Compliance           │ ← All actions logged
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Layer 4: Network Security             │ ← TLS 1.3, VPC isolation
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Layer 3: Authorization (RBAC)         │ ← 4 roles: Admin, Dev, Viewer, Service
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Layer 2: Authentication (JWT)         │ ← API keys + JWT tokens
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Layer 1: Input Validation             │ ← Schema validation, rate limiting
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.2 Authentication

**Method:** JWT-based with API keys

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/agents/security/agent_auth.py

import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class AgentAuthenticator:
    def __init__(self, secret_key: str):
        self.secret_key = secret_key
        self.algorithm = "HS256"
    
    def issue_token(self, agent_id: str, agent_type: str) -> str:
        """Issue JWT for agent"""
        payload = {
            "agent_id": agent_id,
            "agent_type": agent_type,
            "issued_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "expires_at": (datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=30)).isoformat()
        }
        return jwt.encode(payload, self.secret_key, algorithm=self.algorithm)
    
    def verify_token(self, token: str) -> dict:
        """Verify JWT from agent message"""
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.secret_key, algorithms=[self.algorithm])
            expires_at = datetime.fromisoformat(payload["expires_at"])
            if datetime.utcnow() > expires_at:
                raise ValueError("Token expired")
            return payload
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid token: {e}")
```

**Storage:**
- API keys stored in database with bcrypt hashing
- JWT secret in Kubernetes Secrets (not environment variables)
- Auto-rotation every 90 days

### 5.3 Authorization (RBAC)

**4 Roles:**

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Admin** | All permissions (CRUD tests, settings, agents) | CTO, VP Engineering |
| **Developer** | Create/read tests, read settings | Development team |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to tests and settings | Stakeholders, QA |
| **Service Account** | Create/read tests (no settings) | CI/CD pipelines |

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
    role_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    permissions JSONB NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO roles (role_name, permissions) VALUES
('admin', '{"tests": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"], "settings": ["read", "update"], "agents": ["read", "restart"]}'),
('developer', '{"tests": ["create", "read"], "settings": ["read"]}'),
('viewer', '{"tests": ["read"], "settings": ["read"]}'),
('service_account', '{"tests": ["create", "read"]}');
```

**Middleware:**
```python
# backend/api/auth.py

from fastapi import HTTPException, Depends, Security
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

security = HTTPBearer()

async def verify_api_key(credentials = Security(security)):
    """Verify API key and return user with permissions"""
    api_key = credentials.credentials
    
    user = await db.fetchrow("""
        SELECT u.user_id, r.permissions
        FROM api_keys ak
        JOIN users u ON ak.user_id = u.user_id
        JOIN roles r ON u.role_id = r.role_id
        WHERE ak.key_hash = $1
    """, hash(api_key))
    
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API key")
    
    return user

def require_permission(resource: str, action: str):
    """Decorator to check permissions"""
    async def checker(user = Depends(verify_api_key)):
        perms = user["permissions"]
        if resource not in perms or action not in perms[resource]:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Permission denied")
        return user
    return checker

# Usage
@app.post("/api/v2/tests/generate")
async def generate_tests(
    request: TestGenerationRequest,
    user = Depends(require_permission("tests", "create"))
):
    # User has permission to create tests
    ...
```

### 5.4 Network Security (TLS 1.3)

**nginx Configuration:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name api.aitest.example.com;
    
    # TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.aitest.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.aitest.example.com/privkey.pem;
    
    # TLS 1.3 only (most secure)
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384';
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
    
    # HSTS (force HTTPS for 1 year)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
    
    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

**Certificate Renewal:**
- Let's Encrypt (free, auto-renews every 90 days)
- Certbot cron job: `0 0 * * 0 certbot renew --quiet`

### 5.5 Audit Logging

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(50),
    resource_id VARCHAR(100),
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    request_body JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_user ON audit_log(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_timestamp ON audit_log(timestamp);
```

**Middleware:**
```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def audit_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    """Log all API requests"""
    user_id = request.state.user.get("user_id") if hasattr(request.state, "user") else None
    
    response = await call_next(request)
    
    await db.execute("""
        INSERT INTO audit_log (user_id, action, ip_address, user_agent)
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
    """, user_id, request.url.path, request.client.host, request.headers.get("user-agent"))
    
    return response
```

**Retention:** 90 days (GDPR compliance)

### 5.6 Secrets Management

| **R9** | Phase 2 integration breaks existing functionality | Medium | High | Feature flags, gradual rollout (5%→100%), A/B testing | Developer A |

### 6.2 Risk Mitigation Plans

**R1: Infrastructure Delays (Low Risk in Phase 3)**
- **Trigger:** N/A - no external infrastructure dependencies
- **Action:** Continue using existing Phase 2 PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Cost:** Zero impact
- **Decision Maker:** N/A

**R2: LLM Cost Overrun**
- **Trigger:** Monthly cost exceeds $200 (125% of Phase 3 budget)
- **Action:** 
  1. Enable caching (30% savings) - immediate
  2. Review token usage by agent, optimize prompts
  3. Switch Evolution Agent to GPT-4-mini if needed
- **Cost:** Potential quality degradation from 95% to 85%
- **Decision Maker:** Developer A (escalate to CTO if exceeds $300)

**R4: Low Test Generation Accuracy**
- **Trigger:** Test generation accuracy <80% for 2 consecutive sprints
- **Action:**
  1. A/B test 5 prompt variants
  2. Increase Evolution Agent to GPT-4 (from GPT-4-mini)
  3. Add human-in-the-loop feedback for 100 samples
- **Cost:** $50 additional LLM costs + 2 days effort
- **Decision Maker:** Developer A

**R8: Learning System Degrades Quality**
- **Trigger:** Test pass rate drops >20% after prompt optimization
- **Action:**
  1. Immediately rollback to previous prompt variant (< 1 min)
  2. Review experiment logs for root cause
  3. Mark failed variant as "do_not_use"
  4. Increase exploration rate from 10% to 20% for 1 week
- **Cost:** 1 day investigation
- **Decision Maker:** Developer A

### 6.3 Issue Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Response Time | Escalation Path | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | Immediate | Developer A → CTO | Production outage, data breach |
| **P1 (High)** | <4 hours | Developer A → VP Eng | Sprint goal at risk, budget overrun |
| **P2 (Medium)** | <24 hours | Developer A → Team | Minor delays, test failures |
| **P3 (Low)** | <72 hours | Developer A | Documentation gaps, UI bugs |
